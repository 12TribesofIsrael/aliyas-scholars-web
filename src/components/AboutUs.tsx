            <p className="text-lg mb-4">
              At Aliyas Little Scholars, we believe that when children play, they learnâ€”and when they learn, they thrive. 
              Our play-rich environments spark curiosity and encourage exploration, helping children grow in every way.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg mb-4">
              We're more than just childcare; we're a community dedicated to nurturing the whole child through 
              educational activities, caring relationships, and safe spaces to explore and develop.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              Our qualified and experienced teachers create environments where children can discover, 
              create and develop important skills that will serve them throughout their lives.
