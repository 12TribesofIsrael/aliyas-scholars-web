            <p className="text-lg mb-4">
              At Aliyas Little Scholars, we believe that when children play, they learnâ€”and when they learn, they thrive. 
              Our play-rich environments spark curiosity and encourage exploration, helping children grow in every way.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg mb-4">
              We're more than just childcare; we're a community dedicated to nurturing the whole child through 
              educational activities, caring relationships, and safe spaces to explore and develop.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              Our qualified and experienced teachers create environments where children can discover, 
              create and develop important skills that will serve them throughout their lives.

                <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                  We believe in the power of positive affirmations to build confidence and self-esteem in young children.
                  Every day, our little scholars recite these important words as part of our morning routine.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                  These affirmations help children develop a growth mindset and believe in their abilities as they learn and grow.
                  When children see themselves as smart, brave, important, and scholarly, they approach challenges with confidence.
